# Gym-Management-System
This is our AOOP course Project .This project is about Gym application using JavaFX .We used Scene Builder for UI designs, for backend code we used java ,for storage we used .json file, and to do communication between different windows we used Server Socket (socket Bus).Therefore, it was our first big stage project .We could do way more than it .We have learned many things from our mistakes for our next big stage projects and we hope we will do way better project's next time.
